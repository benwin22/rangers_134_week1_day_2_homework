                <h5>Photos, Development, Family</h5>


                <p>I am a photographer based in Texas. My subjects tend to flow around nature, people, work and
                    lifestyle. I love shooting in the field, in the studio, and everywhere in between. I shoot
                    professional headshots, portraits, special events, live music, case studies, products, and content
                    for marketing, brand awareness, social media, and websites. I have studied web development in the
                    past and am now embarking on a new career journey with <a id="link"
                        href="https://www.codingtemple.com/">Coding Temple</a> Temple to become a Full Stack Developer.
                    I have two young boys who love to play legos, get dirty, and cause trouble, as well as a very
                    energetic dog and a very chill cat.

                <h3>Interests</h3>
                <h5>Coffee, Food, Travel</h5>

                <p>Coffee is an everyday staple of mine. I make japanese cold brew pour-overs every moring (and
                    afternoon) to keep rockin.</p>
                <p>Food is something everyone loves! I cook 75% of my families meals and try new recipes as often as I
                    can. I love trying dishes from all over, but my main go-to's are pho, bun bo hue, mexican street
                    tacos, ramen, sushi, and good oysters, when I have the extra cash!</p>
                <p>Travel is a luxury that I attempt as often as I can. My family is from Germany, so I have spent a
                    decent amount of time in major cities there, as well as living in a town called Hildesheim during
                    college. I've also
                    been to Gautamala, Costa Rica, Mexico, Netherlands, Denmark, France and all over the United States.
                    I spent much of my 20's mid 30's playing live music. However, these days I like to spend time with
                    my family, watch soccer & baseball, cook and enjoy a less hectic life.
